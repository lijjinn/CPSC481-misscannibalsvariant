# MissCannibalsVariant

##  Project Overview
This project solves the **Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle** using Python.  
In this puzzle, missionaries and cannibals must cross a river using a boat that can carry up to **3 people**. The challenge is to move everyone safely without ever leaving missionaries outnumbered by cannibals on either side of the river.  

The program uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find valid solutions.
